# **Machine Learning Mini Projects - All Models**

This repository contains 15 mini projects covering a diverse range of machine learning models and data processing techniques. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience by implementing various machine learning algorithms, working with real-world datasets, and understanding fundamental data processing techniques.

I have leveraged resources such as YouTube tutorials, online courses, and Kaggle datasets to build and train these models. One of the projects also incorporates a Kaggle dataset (`train.csv`) for training and evaluation.

## **Understanding Machine Learning**

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It improves automatically through experience using statistical techniques.

### **Types of Machine Learning:**
- **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data and learns to map inputs to the correct output (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm discovers patterns in unlabeled data, such as clustering or anomaly detection.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: A mix of supervised and unsupervised learning, using small amounts of labeled data combined with a larger set of unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Involves decision-making based on rewards and penalties, commonly used in gaming and robotics.

## **Data Processing Techniques**

Data preprocessing is an essential step in machine learning to ensure clean, structured, and meaningful data for model training.

### **Key Data Processing Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Data Transformation** â€“ Normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Creating or modifying features to improve model performance.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction** â€“ Reducing dataset complexity while retaining essential information (e.g., PCA).
5. **Data Splitting** â€“ Dividing datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.
